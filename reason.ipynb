Works by authors like Homer, Shakespeare, and Tolstoy transport readers into distant realms and eras while grappling with themes such as love, power, and morality. These texts challenge us to question our assumptions, confront human frailties, and celebrate resilience. Often written in elevated language and complex structures, they encourage deep reading and reflection. Though centuries may separate modern audiences from these authors, their words resonate with emotional honesty and vibrant storytelling. Classical literature thus endures as a cornerstone of education, culture, and profound intellectual engagement.\",\n",
